Mini Project 2

Project Overview

Mini Project 2 is built on Project 1 (Project 1 was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Mini Project 2 took everything from the previous project and turned it into a react app. This is a web application that combines a React frontend and an Express backend. I included a backend app (express) so I could scrape data in order for my GameDay page to execute a list of game schedules. The app allows female tackle football players to connect world-wide with other players, coaches, and fans. 

Features
User authentication: Users can sign up and have their name displayed on the dashboard page. 
Player cards: Users can swipe right to follow a player
Teams Map: Users can locate teams world-wide via the interactive map 

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Express: A web application framework for Node.js.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
